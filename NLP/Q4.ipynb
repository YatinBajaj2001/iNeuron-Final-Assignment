            "On average, the world’s temperature is about 1.5°C higher than during the start of the industrial revolution in the late 1700s. Especially during the early modern period from the early 16th century to as far as the late 18the century, also commonly referred to as “The Scientific Revolution” or “The Enlightenment”, modern technology leapt ahead in development in such a short time frame compared to all of history. To understand the concept of Global Warming and its causes and effects, we need to take an in-depth look into many factors that affect the temperature of the planet and what that means for the future of the world. Additionally, at the state or government level, world leaders need to create concrete plans and step programmes to ensure that no further harm is being caused to the environment in general. Climate change is not just the rise or fall of temperature of different areas of the world; it is also a change in the rain cycles, wind patterns, cyclone frequencies, sea levels, etc. Simply put, as the need for consumption of the population increases, both the utilisation of natural resources and the waste generated from the use of said resources have also increased massively. Some of which can be controlled personally by individuals but others are only expected to be solved by communities and the world leaders and activists at the global level. Solution for Global Warming\n",
            "Global Warming can not be blamed on individuals; however, it can be tackled and maintained from worsening starting at the individual level. In 1950, the world’s CO2 emissions were at 6 billion tonnes which had quadrupled in volume until 1990, just 40 years later to 22 billion tonnes.\n"
